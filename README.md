# Wonder Phone - a space for you to wonder about the world

## About
Wonder Phone is a reimplementation of the [Wonder Corner](https://www.mycupoftea.org/wonder-corner) project built in Spring, 2017 as my Master's thesis at ITP, NYU.

It is a research project exploring curiosity and adult learning, where adults are invited to explore the questions they are embarrassed to ask in public (based on research that adults are less likely to share compared to children).

More about research and initial project: [https://www.mycupoftea.org/wonder-corner](https://www.mycupoftea.org/wonder-corner).

Here I'm demoing project at Fullstack Academy of Code:
